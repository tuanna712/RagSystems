# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) System Repository

Welcome to the repository for the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This project explores different approaches to RAG, ranging from the naive RAG approach to advanced and modular versions.

## Overview

The RAG system combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing tasks. It leverages pre-existing knowledge sources for retrieval and then generates responses or outputs based on the retrieved information.

## Approaches

### Naive RAG

The naive RAG approach is a straightforward implementation of the RAG system. It involves basic retrieval and generation mechanisms without significant optimizations or enhancements.

### Advanced RAG

The advanced RAG approach enhances the basic RAG system by incorporating sophisticated retrieval and generation techniques. It may involve advanced algorithms, neural architectures, or fine-tuning strategies to improve performance and accuracy.

### Modular RAG

The modular RAG approach breaks down the RAG system into reusable and interchangeable components. It allows for greater flexibility and customization, enabling users to tailor the system to their specific requirements and integrate with other NLP pipelines seamlessly.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `naive_rag/`: Contains code and documentation for the naive RAG approach.
- `advanced_rag/`: Includes implementations and resources for the advanced RAG approach.
- `modular_rag/`: Houses modules and components for the modular RAG approach.

## Getting Started
